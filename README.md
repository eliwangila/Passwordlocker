    -   Your application should have an authentication system that enables a user to log into their account and view their credentials. A user should be able to login to their account using the password that they created and NOT any password.
    -   Your project should make use of doc strings to document methods and functions.
    -   Your project must have a test class that test each individual method in your classes.
